                <p>
                    Hi there! I'm passionate about web development and design. I love creating beautiful and functional websites that provide a great user experience. My name is Teresa Rodriguez. I was born in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lindsay.ca.us/home" style="color: #333">Lindsay, California</a>, and I am 32 years old. I have a one-year-old daughter, Noemi. I have worked for Amazon for 6 years as a Process Assistant and believe now I need to change my occupation and do something I enjoy. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/teresa-terry-rodriguez/" style="color:  #333">Click here for my LinkedIn</a>

                <h2>My Blog</h2>
                <p>I have learned so much in this program. I became interested in taking this course because of my old MySpace days. I loved making profile layouts and reorganizing the top 8 friends that always caused so much drama in the past.</p>
                <h2>8-5-2023</h2>
                <p>In this page, you will see my beautiful navigation bar that highlights when you hover over it. It was something that I really wanted to achieve, and I believe I have. You will also see the transparency backgrounds that were added to make the website more legible.</p>
                <p>It was difficult adding more character to this page, ensuring that I didn't miss anything. I feel like I can do more, but I need to learn the new skills that are yet to come. I've come a long way from project 1 to project 2. I am very happy with my achievements and looking forward to the next lessons.</p>
